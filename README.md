# Musical Insights Dashboard
Dashboard page with multiple charts.

## Overview:
Create a dynamic and interactive Musical Insights Dashboard that leverages our Flask-powered API to showcase trends and insights in the world of music. User will have the option to filter by date and see visualizations of music insights for that day.

1. World Map: showing countries featured in dataset - possibly hovertext with top song
2. Bar Chart: top 10 artists for the date chosen
3. Pie Chart: top genres for the date chosen
4. Mystery Chart: danceability factor of top songs from the date chosen

## Features:

1. Store dataset in a database. [SQLite database to store the collected Spotify data.]
2. Flask-powered API to fetch and handle data the database and have data in JSON format at a url.
3. Using JavaScript, connect & fetch data from Flask powered API and store the array in a variable.
4. Filter the data and prep for visualization including a JavaScript library (one that we did not cover in class) for dynamic data visualizations.
5. User-driven interactions such as dropdowns to allow users to filter data by genres, artists, or time periods. 

At the outset, the whole team will collaboratively work together during class project sessions to complete the initial steps of environment setup, data handling, and database setup. Following this collaborative effort, each member of the team will individually create a distinct visualization for the dashboard. We will then collaborate as a team to conduct user interface testing. Throughout the project, each team member is accountable for regularly updating the project presentation slides with their respective visualizations and insights.
